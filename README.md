# Celebrity Face Detection Using YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time celebrity face detection system using the YOLOv8 model and OpenCV. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for object detection and provides high accuracy in identifying celebrity faces in images and videos.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to detect and recognize celebrity faces using the YOLOv8 model. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) is a deep learning-based object detection model known for its speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.

This system can process both images and video streams, identifying multiple faces simultaneously, and can be extended for larger datasets.

## Features
- Real-time detection of celebrity faces in images and videos.
- Utilizes YOLOv8 for efficient and accurate face detection.
- Integration with OpenCV for image processing.
- Capable of handling multiple face detections at once.

- ## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8**: For object detection.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data handling.
